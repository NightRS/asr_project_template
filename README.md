# ASR project barebones

## Installation guide

You can download `evaluate_results.ipynb` and run it yourself (I was using Google Colab). It has all the necessary commands included.

## Brief Report

I encountered some issues when using the template:

- The training loop seemed to make more steps than specified in the config. Turns out that in `asr_project_template/hw_asr/trainer/trainer.py`, line 87 the loop looks like this:

```
for batch_idx in range(inf):
    …
    if batch_idx >= self.len_epoch:
        break
```

so basically the epoch had the length of `self.len_epoch + 1`.

- The template doesn’t handle the absence of the LR scheduler well, but there are use cases when you don’t want to use one.

You can check out my code to find out how I dealt with it.

Regarding the model training.

You can find logs of my final training here: https://wandb.ai/night_rs/asr_project. I used the `ls_first` config for 30 epochs and the `ls_second` config for 3 epochs. My final model is a combination of ideas from DeepSpeech and DeepSpeech2 papers. It can reach `18 CER` on the clean test part of Librispeech. The model is named LinGRUModel and consists of 7 hidden layers: 4 fully connected and 3 bidirectional recurrent (GRU).

My code has 4 necessary augmentations implemented, as well as an LM inside the beam search function.

The training time greatly (negatively) impacted the experiment variety. Unfortunately, I didn't implement the convolution layer in my model as I was getting infinite loss since the second batch. A good convolutional layer could have reduced the training time. A better-tuned optimizer (I used standard Adam) could have been a plus as well.
